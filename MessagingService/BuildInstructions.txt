Third-party libraries used by the app are pre-compiled and checked in to the lib subdirectory
in Common/source/ThirdParty under the appropriate platform.  In general, the header
files for Third part libraries will also be under the Common/source/ThirdParty directory.

However, boost is so large and most of it is header only so the headers for boost are not included.
In order to use the boost headers, you will need to compile boost onto your own system.  
Follow tbe BuildInstrctions under Common/source/ThirdParty/boost prior to the first time running through
this build process.

Also, you will need to install CMake on your system prior to the first time running through 
this build process.


-----------------
To make in windows:
-----------------
1.  modify SetWorkspace.bat to set WORKSPACE to the path to this directory and to set CMAKEHOME to the path to CMake.exe
	(Or alternatively, add the CMake directory to the PATH environment variable)
2.  open a command prompt and navigate to this directory
3.  At the command prompt, perform the following:
		SetWorkspace.bat
		CommandScripts\WinTools\Build_All.bat 
4.  The previous step will create the Visual Studio projects and solution: %WORKSPACE%\build_WinHost\Common.sln
5.  Open Common.sln in Visual Studio and build.  The output will be in %WORKSPACE%\OutputDebug\WinHost or %WORKSPACE%\OutputRelease\WinHost
OPTIONAL: Build_All.bat completely rebuilds all projects including test projects.  You may run CommandScripts\WinTools\Build_Min.bat to do a minimal build

-----------------
To make in Ubuntu Linux:
-----------------
1. Open a Terminal and navigate to this directory
2. At the Terminal prompt, perform the following:
		export WORKSPACE=path/to/this/directory
		export COMMON_WORKSPACE=path/to/Common/directory
		./CommandScripts/LinuxTools/BuildLinux.sh
3.  The previous step will compile the application.  The output will be in $WORKSPACE/OutputRelease/LinuxHost
OPTIONAL:  You can define the following environment variables to modify the build
		export NO_CLEAN_FIRST=0		(to completely rebuild all projects)
		export BYPASS_TESTS=1		(to skip creating the unit test projects)
		
-----------------
To make for Cylon:
-----------------
1. $WORKSPACE/LinuxTools/SetEnvCrossCompileCylon.sh sets up variables for cross compiling.  
It is called by BuildCylon.sh.  The paths are set for using the compiler installed by apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi.
You may need to change the environment variables in this script to match your cross compiler toolchain settings.
2. Follow the Ubuntu Linux instructions changing Linux to Cylon in all steps

-----------------
When making changes to the Message Service proto file:
-----------------
1.	Checkout source\_ProtoFiles\CommonMessages.proto
2.	Checkout source\Product\CommonMessages\CommonMessages.pb.cc
3.	Checkout source\Product\CommonMessages\CommonMessages.pb.h
4.	Checkout source\CSharp\Product\CommonMessages\CommonMessages.cs
5.	Edit CommonMessages.proto (be sure to end fields with semi-colon ; not comma , )
6.	Open command prompt
7.	Run SetWorkspace.bat
8.	Run CommandScripts\WinTools\CompileProtoMessages.bat
9.	Open build_WinHost\MsgService.sln, switch to release and rebuild.
10.	Open source\CSharp\TestApp_CS.sln, switch to release and rebuild.

-----------------
Third Party Libraries
-----------------
Third party libraries are in WORKSPACE\source\ThirdParty.
The prebuild library files will be in WORKSPACE\source\ThirdParty\lib\XyzHost  (where Xyz is the type of host: Win, Linux, Cylon)
For the third party libraries, the include files, tar or zip of the source code, and instructions for building them will be under their respective directories.

-----------------
CMake files
-----------------
The top level CMakeList.txt in WORKSPACE starts the CMake process.  It includes COMMON_WORKSPACE/source/CMakeList.txt and WORKSPACE/source/CMakeList.txt.
The WORKSPACE/source/CMakeLists.txt includes CMakeInclude.txt which is used to find all the third party libraries needed by all the projects to be built.
The WORKSPACE/source/CMakeLists.txt also includes each of the CMakeLists.txt for each project under the Product and Tests directories.

NOTE:  Currently projects are being built statically because the Cylon board does not have standard c++ libraries installed.  
We may want to change this in future.
