-----------------
To make in windows:
-----------------
Pre Steps needed once for each computer: 
	a.  Download and install CMake
	b.  Follow source\ThirdParty\boost\BuildInstructions.txt
1.  modify SetWorkspace.bat to set WORKSPACE to the path to this directory and to set CMAKEHOME to the path to CMake.exe
2.  open a command prompt and navigate to this directory
3.  At the command prompt, perform the following:
		SetWorkspace.bat
		CommandScripts\WinTools\Build_All.bat
4.  The previous step will create the Visual Studio projects and solution: %WORKSPACE%\build_WinHost\Common.sln
5.  Open Common.sln in Visual Studio and build.  The output will be in %WORKSPACE%\OutputDebug\WinHost or %WORKSPACE%\OutputRelease\WinHost
OPTIONAL: Build_All.bat completely rebuilds all projects including test projects.  You may run CommandScripts\WinTools\Build_Min.bat to do a minimal build

-----------------
To make in Ubuntu Linux:
-----------------
Pre Steps needed once for each computer/VM
	a.	sudo apt-get install cmake
	b.	sudo apt-get install autoconf
	c.	sudo apt-get install libtool

1. Open a Terminal and navigate to this directory
2. At the Terminal prompt, perform the following:
		export WORKSPACE=path/to/this/directory
		./CommandScripts/LinuxTools/BuildLinux.sh
3.  The previous step will compile the application.  The output will be in $WORKSPACE/OutputRelease/LinuxHost
OPTIONAL:  You can define the following environment variables to modify the build
		export NO_CLEAN_FIRST=0		(to completely rebuild all projects)
		export BYPASS_TESTS=1		(to skip creating the unit test projects)
		
-----------------
To make for Cylon:
-----------------
Pre Steps needed once for each computer/VM
	a.	sudo apt-get install cmake
	b.	sudo apt-get install autoconf
	c.	sudo apt-get install libtool
	d.	sudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabi
1. $WORKSPACE/LinuxTools/SetEnvCrossCompileCylon.sh sets up variables for cross compiling.  
It is called by BuildCylon.sh.  The paths are set for using the compiler installed by apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi.
You may need to change the environment variables in this script to match your cross compiler toolchain settings.
2. Follow the Ubuntu Linux instructions changing Linux to Cylon in all steps

-----------------
Third Party Libraries
-----------------
Third party libraries are in WORKSPACE\source\ThirdParty.
The prebuild library files will be in WORKSPACE\source\ThirdParty\lib\XyzHost  (where Xyz is the type of host: Win, Linux, Cylon)
For the third party libraries, the include files, tar or zip of the source code, and instructions for building them will be under their respective directories.

-----------------
CMake files
-----------------
The top level CMakeList.txt in WORKSPACE starts the CMake process.  It includes WORKSPACE/source/CMakeList.txt.
The WORKSPACE/source/CMakeLists.txt includes CMakeInclude.txt which is used to find all the third party libraries needed by all the projects to be built.
The WORKSPACE/source/CMakeLists.txt also includes each of the CMakeLists.txt for each project under the Product and Tests directories.

NOTE:  Currently projects are being built statically because the Cylon board does not have standard c++ libraries installed.  
We may want to change this in future.
