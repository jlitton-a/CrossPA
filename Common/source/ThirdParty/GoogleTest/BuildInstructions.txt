We use googlemock and googletest for unit testing of our executables.
This procedure assumes ${WORKSPACE} points to the Common workspace.

LINUX-Ubuntu and LINUX-Cylon
============
Note the procedure below creates the googlemock and googletest static libraries
for the Cylon cross compilers.  To install googlemock and
googletest  for the LinuxHost x86_64 compiler, delete the entire
googletest-master directory and repeat the steps below with
SetLinuxEnv.sh.

Installation procedure:
1. cd ${WORKSPACE}
2. . script/LinuxTools/Set<YOUR HOST HERE>Env.sh
3.	cd $COMMON_THIRDPARTY_HOME/GoogleTest
4.	unzip googletest-master.zip
5. cd googletest-master/googletest
6. autoreconf -fvi
7.	./configure --build=${CROSS_COMPILE_BUILD} --host=${CROSS_COMPILE_HOST} --prefix=${CROSS_COMPILE_FULL_HOST}/usr
8.	make 
9. cd googletest-master/googlemock
10. autoreconf -fvi
11.	./configure --build=${CROSS_COMPILE_BUILD} --host=${CROSS_COMPILE_HOST} --prefix=${CROSS_COMPILE_FULL_HOST}/usr
12.	make 

The required static libraries are now in googlemock/lib/.libs and
googletest/lib/.libs.  They are:

- libgmock.a
- libgtest.a

Copy these to the proper ${THIRDPARTY}/GoogleTest/<YOUR HOST HERE>/...  directory.

unzip the googletest-master
build gtest
	Go to googletest-master\googletest\msvc directory and open the gtest-md.sln file
	Select the Debug configuration and compile the gtest-md project
	Select the Release configuration and compile the gtest-md project
build gmock
	Go to googletest-master\googlemock\msvc directory and open the gmock.sln file
	Select properties on the gmock project and goto C/C++ - Code Generation - Runtime Library and change to /MDd for Debug configuration and /MD for Release configuration
	Select the Debug configuration and compile the gmock project
	Select the Release configuration and compile the gmock project
Copy the gmock.lib and gmock.pdb files from googlemock\msvc\2010\Debug and from the googletest\msvc\2010\Release directories to the proper ${THIRDPARTY}\GoogleTest\<YOUR HOST HERE>\...  directory.
Rename gtestd.lib to gtest.lib in googletest\msvc\gtest\Debug directory and copy to the ${COMMON_THIRDPARTY_LIB_PATH_DEBUG} directory.
Copy gtest.lib from the googletest\msvc\gtest\Release directory to the ${COMMON_THIRDPARTY_LIB_PATH_RELEASE} directory.
If this is a new version of google test:
   copy the entire gmock directory from googlemock\include\ to ${THIRDPARTY}\GoogleTest\Include directory
   copy the entire gtest directory from googletest\include\ to ${THIRDPARTY}\GoogleTest\Include directory
